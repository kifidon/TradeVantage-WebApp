## Trading Logic
### Entry Conditions
- **Buy Signal**:
  - Price crosses **above** the Bollinger Bands middle band.
  - Fast MA crosses **above** Slow MA.
  - Trend filter confirms **uptrend**.
  - Number of buy trades for the candle **is within limit**.

- **Sell Signal**:
  - Price crosses **below** the Bollinger Bands middle band.
  - Fast MA crosses **below** Slow MA.
  - Trend filter confirms **downtrend**.
  - Number of sell trades for the candle **is within limit**.

### Trade Execution
- The EA opens trades using the **OrderSend()** function.
- Trades are placed with a **stop loss and take profit**.
- Buy orders use the **Bid price**, and Sell orders use the **Ask price**.
- The EA prevents overtrading by limiting trades per candle.

### Trend Detection
- Uses the **getTrend()** function to analyze the middle Bollinger Band over the last `BackTrack` candles.
- If the **current middle band** is above the **average of past bands**, the trend is **up**.
- Otherwise, the trend is **down**.

## Installation & Usage
1. Copy the **BB_MA_EA.mq4** file to `MQL4/Experts/` in your MetaTrader 4 directory.
2. Restart MetaTrader 4 or refresh the **Navigator** panel.
3. Attach **BB_MA_EA** to a chart.
4. Configure the input parameters as needed.
5. Enable **AutoTrading** to allow trade execution.

## Notes
- The EA checks if it is running on the allowed account before executing trades.
- If an order fails, the error is printed in the **Expert Logs**.
- The EA does **not** use martingale or grid strategiesâ€”each trade is independent.

## Disclaimer
This EA is for **educational purposes**. Use at your own risk. Always test on a **demo account** before using real funds.
